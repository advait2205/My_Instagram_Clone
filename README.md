Features of my Instagram Clone:
 Of  course I cant just replicate original Instagram just by myself..But yeah I have kept all the "SOUL FEATURES" of Instagram except Stories and Messaging cuz they were taking a lot of time and I have been making this app for like 3 months now.Also you cant tag someone in post as of now but yeah you can keep '#' in posts caption.

You can edit your profile, set your own profile picture from your phone's internal storage ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è"Pictures" Directory as well as ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è"Camera" directory...CAUTION: If you are a MI user or in general if in your internal storage in DCIM folder it is labelled as camera then make the folder with name "Camera" or app will crash cuz my app can handle "Pictures" location but not camera pictures location in diff android phones.........You can search someone in search bar by his/her EXACT username and you can follow that user.BUT you will not get notifications of who have followed u or not...U can make post , see your and the person u follow's posts in mainfeed...

Leaving remaining discoveries to You but yeah do add me my username is "its_acharya225"üòâüòâüòâ AND YEAH DON'T FORGET TO POST AND SEND ME YOUR USERNAME IN WP DM SO THAT I CAN TEST THE APP RIGOROUSLY
